    Overview of Java
    ----------------

        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). 
        
        It is designed to be platform-independent, secure, and easy to use. Java applications are compiled to bytecode, which can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying platform.


    Features of Object-Oriented Programming
    -----------------------------------------

        Reusability: Code reuse through inheritance.

        Scalability: Easily extend the code with new functionality.

        Maintainability: Clean code structure that is easier to manage.

        Modularity: Breaking down code into smaller, manageable pieces.

        Flexibility: Easily modify and extend the code.

        Security: Encapsulation helps in protecting data.

        Efficiency: Optimized code execution through polymorphism and inheritance.


    JVM, JDK
    --------

        JVM (Java Virtual Machine): 
            Executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.
            Key components: Class Loader, Bytecode Verifier, and Interpreter.
            Example: Oracle HotSpot JVM, OpenJ9 JVM.

        JDK (Java Development Kit): 
            A development environment for building Java applications.
            Includes: JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compiler (javac), interpreter/loader (java), archiver (jar), documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools.
            Example: Oracle JDK, OpenJDK.

    
    starting template of java
    --------------------------

        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            }
        }

        Explanation:
            - The class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.
            - The main method is the entry point of a Java program.
            - The System.out.println() method is used to print output to the console.
